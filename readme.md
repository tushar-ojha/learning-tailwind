## Getting  started with Tailwind CSS.
 - Use Play CDN to play. Won't work in production
 - mx-4 mx-2 cursor-pointer px-4 py-4 bg-purple-900 font-sans, pt means padding top.
  This is how we write classes inside elements and boom! CSS is applied. No need to remember anything. A secret extension will do this for us.

 - Commands to install and run tailwind properly
    - npm init
    - npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    - npm install vite //to use tailwind in production.
    - "scripts": {"start": "vite"} in package.json
    - npx tailwindcss init
    - Inside tailwind.config.js * in content:[] like this: content:["*"]
    - tailwind css intellisense extension in VS code.
    - npm run start will start website on local host.
    - Control + space bar if suggestion doesn't appear.

 - Search landing page templates to practice CSS or tailwind.

 - Popularly used classes.
   - rounded-3xl to put border radius on image.
   - flex to make any div flexbox.
   - px-3 py-4 pt pb to add padding, similary margin is added.
